NO MONEY

    <h1>Trash Robot App</h1>

    <p>Find sticks, drill holes in them, use them to create structures, replicate the structures.  We call this skeletron</p>

    <a href = "skeletron.html">SKELETRON REPLICATOR SCROLL</a>

<p>
    Find cardboard in the trash and cut it up and turn it into cubes, use those cubes as social media. We call this the Geometron Hypercube.  
</p>


<a href = "hypercube.html">GEOMETRON HYPERCUBE REPLICATOR SCROLL</a>

<p>
    Use the cubes to create an Internet of Dirt, creating soil with compost and using the cubes to distribute soil with seeds in it which grows into a living network.
</p>


<p>
    Get computers from the trash and put trash magic servers on them. you can then put them on the Magic Dump or use them as public media stations out in the world.  Paint them and decorate them in the most maximalist possible fashion.  Put no private or personal information on them ever! never log into google on them! never log into anything! use them ONLY for FREE media!
</p>

<p>
Learn about the philosophy of trash magic by reading the books of Trash Magic.  We will build a world of free things from trash and what we can grow!  And we will do it by making self-replicating media made of trash!</p>

<h1>The Watershed Network</h1>

<p>
    Build out a network along all of the waterways of the world. Use Skeletron to build structures which can hold machines with wheels which can generate power.  Build mesh network nodes onto the skeletron, and put web servers along the rivers at each node.  Turn all of the rivers of the world into a living mesh network built from trash.  Build microscopy with web enabled cameras into each node so that the microbiology of the water can be shared. Build a free science infrastructure onto this so that the whole living water system of the world can go online and we can become one with the water.
</p>

<p>
    As the watershed network scales up, we will base our trash magic civilization on the physical networks along all the waterways.  We will build up an aquaculture along all these waterways which slows down how water flows from the sky to the sea in ways we control and understand and are in communion with.  We will live our lives centered on the water.  There is already plenty of trash along all the waterways to support any arbitrarily advanced replication-based technology in these spaces.  
</p>


<h1>The Street Network</h1>

<p>
The Street Network is a network of people helping each other out along the roads.  People who have resources and are stationary help the folks on the road.  
</p>


<p>
    We will build a network of mechanics and people who can do solar and electrical setups who can help people in vehicles get all their systems set up properly to work comfortably and safely out there on the road.
</p>

<p>
    We will build a supply web where people on the social network can send things for free around the country by courrier from the people on the road. We will also support people on the road by setting up patreon accounts that can get divided amongst travelers according to need.  Also, mutual aid supplies can be stockpiled in homes of people with some space and then dispensed by the people in vehicles to other vehicle people and into the camps. 
</p>

<p>
We will build the social networks between people in the restaurant industry and our network of trash magicians who will make biodiesel out of cooking grease and provide it free as fuel to the people on the road.  We will find ways to use pyrolysis to turn different organic waste streams into gasoline as well, and build a network of free gasoline. Free fuel will be dispensed in 55 gallon steel drums painted in the most garish of colors and with the most attention getting memes on them.
</p>


<p>People on the road will also be supplied with free trash magic servers, free wireless networking apparatus to build out local mesh networks to dispense media to people on the streets.  We will build free science apparatus into these servers as well, so that the overall network can collect data for shared goals.  Then the network as a whole can get science grant money if we can all collectively source data which is of use to some sponsor.  </p>

<p>as our network scales up we will connect more and more with the watershed network, and more and more replace cars and trucks and vans and busses with human sized vehicles, based around bicycle principles but using small electric or biogas drives.  And we can slowly let the road system get taken back by the living Earth as we transition to a human society based on the Watershed and replace the Streets with a more human network of paths which intertwine with the water.</p>
