    <h1>TRASH MAGIC BOOKS</h1>
    

<p>In Trash Magic we build everything we need for a good life from trash and things we can grow and spread it using self-replicating media.</p>

<p>
    This page is hosted on a Trash Magic server on the Magic Dump. The Magic Dump is an unenclosed digital commons. It is digital infrastructure which exists outside of the system of private property and which is created entirely from waste streams of old computers made obsolete by the tech companies.
</p>

<p>
    This is a mutual aid network.  We all say what we can use help with from the network and also how we might be able to help the network, and then manually find each other and help out. We are the algorithm here, there are no apps, no users, no data.  Just public boards we all post on and read and respond to.  Find the others.

        Use hardware from the trash to read books hosted on servers from the trash which tell you how to replicate the whole thing.  These are self-replicating ebooks made of trash!
