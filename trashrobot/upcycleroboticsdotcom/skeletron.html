<p>
Skeletron sticks are selected to be between 3 and 6 feet long, and have quarter inch holes driled in each end along with anywhere else convenient. They are used to create structures by tying the ends with "trash ties", which are lengths of about 18 inches of some kind of parachute cord or shoelace or trash-fabricated or trash-sourced tie material.

<p>
    Use skeletron to build up infrastructure along the watershed network, creating web servers, wireless access points, point to point wireless links, and power generating stations which use the passing water to drive the electronic machines.

<p>There is currently a feed of Skeletron under the 15th street bridge along the South Platte River, using sticks about 4 feet long.  It was a tetrahedron and then it became the top of an octahedron, how much can weg grow and replicate it?</p>
